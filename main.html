                    <p>World War I, also known as the Great War, happened from 1914 to 1918. It was a huge conflict involving many countries around the world. The main causes were rivalry between powerful nations, alliances between countries, and competition for colonies. The war was fought mostly in Europe, but its effects were felt globally. It saw new weapons like machine guns and poison gas causing devastating casualties. The war ended with the Treaty of Versailles, which punished Germany and laid the groundwork for future conflicts. World War I changed the world in many ways and led to the rise of new countries and ideologies.</p>

The main sides were the Allies, which included countries like the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and others, and the Axis powers, like Germany, Japan, and Italy. The war started because Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, wanted more power and land. They invaded other countries, causing a lot of damage and suffering. The fighting spread to many places, including Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. Millions of people died during the war, both soldiers and civilians.</p>
